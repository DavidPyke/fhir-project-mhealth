Clinical Vital Signs is a category that includes the measurements of other factors that
can affect the primary measurement.  When this category is assessed and reported,
the [Basic Vital Signs](basic_vital_signs.html) category must also be assessed
and reported.

Clinical Vital Signs are distinct from [Basic Vital Signs](basic_vital_signs.html)
because this data includes that necessary to interpret the clinical impact of the primary
measurement on the user without making other assumptions. This category focuses on
the ability to measure these other factors rather than the primary measurement.

There are many factors that can influence the measured values. For example, a blood pressure
measurement taken on the left arm can vary slightly, moderately or even severely from
those taken on the right arm depending on many factors, including the presence of peripheral
artery disease[^1]. The capture of laterality (left/right) of the measurement site can be used to
help identify the presence of absence of disease.  Other values, such as the body site
where the measurement was taken (wrist, upper arm or leg), the method by which the
measurement was taken (optic sensor, pneumatic cuff), the user's position when the
measurement was taken, time since recent physical activity, even the cuff
size, can affect interpretation.

This section addresses the capture of additional data required to enable accurate clinical
interpretation.  The failure of a device to support these capabilities does not mean
that its use for monitoring does not have clinical value, but it does mean that additional
steps are likely needed to ensure consistency of results. User education and training,
with written instructions, can sometimes substitute for being able to capture the all
of the data necessary.  Some devices or apps allow additional data to be captured when
a measurement is taken (e.g., comment fields).  These fields can often be used to substitute
for missing device or application features, but may require additional effort when interfacing
with these systems.
