Basic Vital Signs is a category that includes just the measurements of the
most common vital signs that can be measured for a given user.  It is distinct from
[Clinical Vital Signs](clinical_vital_signs.html) because these measurements do not
include other data deemed essential to correctly interpret the clinical impact of this
measurement on the user without making other assumptions. This category focuses on
the ability to measure the fundamental vital sign, rather than these other factors.
