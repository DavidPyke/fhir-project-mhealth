User demographics identifies the user of a device.  It includes critical information
that can be used for matching a device user to patient records in an EHR, such as name,
address, birthdate, user identifiers, and user contact information (which can also be
used to improve user matching to patient records.  This is generally considered to be
static data associated with user identity, rather than other clinical or administrative
information associated with the user. That information would appear in
[User Attributes](user_attributes.html).
