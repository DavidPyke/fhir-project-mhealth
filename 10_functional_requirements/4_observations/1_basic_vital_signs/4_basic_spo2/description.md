The Basic SPO2 category supports the measurement of the user's oxygen saturation.

When this category is evaluated, the [Basic Heart Rate (a.k.a. Pulse)](basic_heart_rate.html)
category must also be evaluated.  This is because oxygen saturation and pulse are very
closely related measurements, and it's nearly impossible for a system to measure oxygen
saturation without having some awareness of heart rate.
