The Basic Heart Rate category supports the measurement of the user's heart rate (a.k.a. pulse).
Technically, pulse is an effect measured in blood vessels as a result of contractions of the heart
(heart rate).  Some devices measure pulse (e.g., smart watches using optical sensors), others
measure heart rate using electrical sensors on the chest.  For the purposes of this specification,
these will all be considered to be measures of the heart rate.
