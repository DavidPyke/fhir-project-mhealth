System capabilities describes the capabilities of a system to one of its clients.  These are
generally static, and may be influenced by [System Configuration](system_configuration.html).
Features in this category enable other systems to potentially negotiate or change their behavior
based on the capabilities the system expresses.  For example, the client (e.g., an app) of a
system (e.g., a device) that has the capability to report level of charge might
check for information about the system charge attribute and alert the user when
the battery is low.  The ability to report the charge is a capability can be
discovered.
