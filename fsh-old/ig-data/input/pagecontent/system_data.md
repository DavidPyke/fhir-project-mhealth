System data includes configuration, capabilities and attributes of a device,
application or infrastructure that describes the essentials to ensure
proper operation of the system. This is information about the technology in use,
rather than the user of that technology (See [User Data](user_data.html)).

The System Data Category includes all requirements from the following subcategories:
 * [System Configuration](system_configuration.html)
   System configuration includes the data that is used to configure a device, application or infrastructure.

 * [System Attributes](system_attributes.html)
   System attributes describe dynamic attributes of a system to one of its clients.
