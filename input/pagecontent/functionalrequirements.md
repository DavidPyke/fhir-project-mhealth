The functional requirements of this implementation guide are distributed in the following
sections.

1. [Attribution of Data](attribution.html)
2. [User Demographics](userdemographics.html)
3. [User Attributes](userattributes.html)
4. [Device Configuration and Capabilities](deviceconfig.html)
5. [Device Attributes](deviceattributes.html)
6. [Observations](observations.html)
    a. [Basic Vitals](basicobservations.html)
        1. [Basic Height and Weight](basicheightweight.html)
        2. [Basic Blood Pressure](basicbloodpressure.html)
        3. [Basic Respiration and Pulse](basicheightweight.html)
        4. [Basic SPO2](basicspo2.html)
        5. [Basic Tempurature](basictempurature.html)
    b. [Clinical Vitals](clinicalobservations.html)
        NOTE: Clinical Vitals adds to reqirements of Basic Vitals. When Clinical
        vitals or any subset are assessed, the SUT must also be tested against
        the rquirements of the related Basic vitals set.
