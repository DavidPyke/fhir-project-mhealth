This section describes general requirements of all systems for which observations are
assessed.  When an assessment is performed on any of the categories for Observations
the requirements in this category **SHALL** also be assessed.

Specifically, if an App, Device or Infrastructure supports reporting for a given measurement
the requirements in this category are tested for each of the measurements that the device
can support.
