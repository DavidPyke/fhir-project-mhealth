# fhir-project-mhealth
Mobile apps and devices provide their own APIs and methods for collecting device data that can be communicated to EHR, PHR and research endpoints. Much of this data can (and has been) readily converted to FHIR resources. However, some limits have been encountered which demonstrate that essential data needed to generate, interpret and use the FHIR resources is sometimes missing. The purpose of this implementation guide is document the functional requirements that can be used to assess devices, applications, and FHIR profiles to ensure that the essential data needed for clinical, patient and research uses is present in communications between applications.

This repository is the source code for the Implementation Guide. 

The currently published version of the guide can be found [here](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-project-mhealth/).
